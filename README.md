# Static Site Generator

A lightweight Python-based static site generator that converts Markdown files to HTML. Built to demonstrate practical implementation of recursion, functions, and classes.

## Core Features
- Converts .md files to .html
- Maintains blog-like structure
- Implements recursive directory traversal
- HTML template injection

## Usage
either using the shell script ./main.sh or using main.py

## Development Notes
Built as a learning exercise for:
- Recursive file handling
- OOP principles
- Template processing
- File I/O operations

### Reflection
- I hate and love recursion
- I love solving big problems
- I hate when I use AI to troubleshoot, feels like my brain matter decreases
- Good code is well planned code
